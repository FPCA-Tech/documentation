A Presentation is a collection of Slides.</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a preview of the current slide in the top right corner of the screen, as well as on the monitor mounted above the main monitor.</p> </li> </ul> <p>5.

Quickly select a blank slide and then find your place in the presentation.</p> <p>6.
